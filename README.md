Traffic Analysis-PREDICTOR-APP

This project analyzes traffic patterns in Chennai, India, to identify congestion hotspots, peak traffic times, and predict future traffic volumes. Using Python-based data science and machine learning techniques, it processes historical traffic data, visualizes trends, and provides actionable insights for urban planning and traffic management.
Project Overview
The Chennai Traffic Analysis project leverages datasets containing traffic volume, time, and location data to:

Clean and preprocess traffic data for analysis.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Visualize traffic volume, congestion levels, and busiest areas using heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs.
Build predictive models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ARIMA) to forecast traffic volumes.
Save results, such as the trained model (best_traffic_volume_model.pkl) and busiest areas (busiest_areas.csv), for further use.

Usage

Prepare Datasets:

Place Banglore_traffic_Dataset.csv and traffic.csv in the project directory.
Ensure the datasets have the required columns (e.g., Date, Traffic Volume, Area Name, etc.) as described in the project documentation.


Run the Main Script:
python main.py

This script:

Loads and cleans the traffic datasets.
Performs EDA and generates visualizations (e.g., traffic volume over time, congestion heatmaps).
Trains machine learning models and forecasts traffic volumes.
Saves the best model as best_traffic_volume_model.pkl and busiest areas as busiest_areas.csv.


View Outputs:

Visualizations will display in pop-up windows or Jupyter Notebook (if used).
Check busiest_areas.csv for a summary of high-traffic areas.
Use best_traffic_volume_model.pkl for future predictions.



Example Visualizations
The project generates the following visualizations:

Line Plot: Traffic volume over time.
Heatmap: Average monthly traffic volume by year.
Histogram: Distribution of congestion levels.
Bar Chart: Average traffic volume by weather conditions.
3D Scatter Plot: Interactive visualization of traffic volume, speed, and congestion.

Predictive Modeling
The project trains three machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and an ARIMA model for time-series forecasting. The best model is saved as best_traffic_volume_model.pkl and can predict traffic volume for future dates. Example prediction:
Predicted Traffic Volume for 2024-10-10: [value]
